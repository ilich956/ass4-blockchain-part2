**NFT Report**

**1. Detailed Explanation of NFTs and Their Functionalities:**

NFTs, or Non-Fungible Tokens, are a type of digital asset that represent ownership or proof of authenticity of a unique item or piece of content, using blockchain technology. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis, NFTs are unique and indivisible, making them ideal for representing digital or physical assets like artwork, collectibles, virtual real estate, and more.

The ERC-721 standard, which stands for Ethereum Request for Comments 721, is one of the most popular standards used for creating NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC-721 defines a set of rules and functions that NFT contracts must follow, including functionalities for token ownership, transfer, and metadata management.

In the provided Solidity smart contract `Ilyas.sol`, an ERC-721 compliant contract is implemented. This contract allows users to create and manage NFTs. Each NFT has a unique identifier, and it can store metadata associated with the token URI. The contract includes a `mint` function, which allows users to create new NFTs by specifying the token URI during the minting process.

**2. Addresses of the Deployed ERC-721 NFT Tokens:**

The deployed address of the ERC-721 contract is: `0xEd6EA49E9cd6719f980E20b612d34F10EA2C3428`
